    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have background knowledge regarding how CNNs work and how to build them using Keras, its time to practice those skills a little more independently in order to build a CNN on your own to solve a image recognition problem. In this lab, you'll practice building an image classifier from start to finish using a CNN.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Load images from a hierarchical file structure using an image datagenerator \n",
    "- Apply data augmentation to image files before training a neural network \n",
    "- Build a CNN using Keras \n",
    "- Visualize and evaluate the performance of CNN models \n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the Images\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this lab concerns lung xray images for pneumonia. The original dataset is from Kaggle. We have downsampled this dataset in order to reduce training time for you when you design and fit your model to the data. ⏰ It is anticipated that this process will take approximately one hour to run on a standard machine, although times will vary depending on your particular computer and set up. At the end of this lab, you are welcome to try training on the complete dataset and observe the impact on the model's overall accuracy. \n",
